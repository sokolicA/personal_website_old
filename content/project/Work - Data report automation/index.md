My task is to create automated workflows that create reports, which are sent to the end users at regularly occurring intervals.

The standard workflow encompasses:

 - Merging data from multiple tables in the data warehouse.
 - Cleaning and preparing data.
 - Calculating summaries, creating interactive tables and plots.
 - Assembling data in an interactive HTML document (the end product).
 - Automatically sending the reports to selected e-mail addresses.
