With my increasing doing of repetitive tasks I found the need to create my own R package [atools](https://github.com/sokolicA/atools) that includes reusable functions from different projects that I completed.

Prior to this I used to source one or more of my R scripts with different kinds of functions. Those functions cluttered my global environment and were harder to access and maintain, at least compared to the functions included in the package, which are easily accessible and are not loaded in the global environment. 

As a side note, I have also started developing an internal R package at work, which will allow for easier sharing of our functions and their better upkeep and testing.
