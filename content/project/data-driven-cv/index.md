The goal of this project is to have a simple, easily accessible and updatable CV! 

The data is stored in a Google spreadsheet and is then imported in R and assembled in a simple, nice looking format.

The code used is accessible [here](https://github.com/sokolicA/CV) and is forked from nstrayer/datadrivencv on GitHub and updated to fit my own needs. I like the idea as a whole so I might make bigger deviations from the forked code in the future...
